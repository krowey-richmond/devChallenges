# DevChallenges Projects 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to various **DevChallenges** projects.  
The goal is to strengthen my frontend development skills by building real-world UI components and pages while following best practices.

Each project focuses on **clean structure**, **responsive design**, and **practical problem-solving**, rather than just completing tasks.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Practice real-world frontend challenges
- Improve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
- Build a strong, credible GitHub portfolio
- Develop discipline through consistent project-based learning

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git & GitHub

> Tools may expand over time (e.g., React, TailwindCSS), but fundamentals come first.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each challenge lives in its own folder:

```txt
devchallenges-projects/
│
├── challenge-name/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── script.js
│   └── README.md (optional, challenge-specific)
│
└── README.md
````

This structure keeps projects isolated, readable, and easy to review.

## 📌 Completed Challenges

* ✅ Coming soon

> Each completed challenge will be added here with a short description and live preview link (if deployed).

---

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

* Mastery over rushing
* Fundamentals before frameworks
* Small, consistent wins
* Clean code > clever code

This repository is treated as a **learning lab**, not just a task dump.

---

## 🌍 Live Previews

Projects will be deployed using:

* GitHub Pages (initially)
* Other platforms later if needed

---

## 📈 Progress

This repository will evolve as my skills grow.
Older projects will remain untouched to clearly show progress over time.

---

## 🤝 Acknowledgements
