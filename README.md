# DevChallenges Portfolio

This repository serves as a **central hub** for my DevChallenges projects. Each challenge lives in its own folder and is accessible through a simple, clean HTML homepage that acts as a navigation layer across all projects.

The focus of this repository is **clarity, structure, and frontend fundamentals**—showing how individual challenge solutions fit into a coherent, professional workflow.

## 🧭 How This Repository Works

* The root of the repository contains an `index.html` file.
* This page functions as a **mini portfolio / directory**.
* Each listed item links directly to a DevChallenges project inside this folder.
* Every project has its own self-contained structure and can be viewed independently.

This mirrors how real-world frontend work is organized: one entry point, many focused implementations.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

* Practice real-world frontend layouts and components
* Reinforce semantic HTML structure
* Improve CSS layout, spacing, and responsiveness
* Maintain clean navigation between multiple projects
* Build a portfolio that clearly shows progression over time

This is a **learning-focused but recruiter-readable** repository.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* HTML5 (semantic structure)
* CSS3 (layout, typography, responsiveness)
* Google Fonts (Inter)
* Git & GitHub for version control

JavaScript and frameworks may be introduced later, but fundamentals come first.

---

## ♿ Accessibility & Usability

Care is taken to ensure:

* Proper use of headings and semantic elements
* Clear navigation links
* Readable typography and spacing
* Responsive behavior across screen sizes

Accessibility and usability are treated as **core requirements**, not afterthoughts.

---

## 📈 Progress & Maintenance

* Older challenges are preserved as-is to show growth
* New challenges will be added incrementally
* The portfolio homepage will evolve as the project list grows

Consistency and discipline matter more than volume.
